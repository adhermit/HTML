    <h2> Raman Maharjan</h2>
    <h3> IT Student</h3>
    <p> I'm currently an IT student at Keyce Academy, having completed my 3rd semester, with hands-on experience in various programming languages and technologies. My academic background includes strong foundations in Algorithms, Database Management, SQL, and programming with C, C++, JavaScript, and Python. I also have practical experience building responsive web applications with React JS and cross-platform mobile apps using React Native. </p>
    <p>In addition to my technical skills, I've gained valuable real-world experience through part-time jobs in the service industry, where I honed essential soft skills like communication, teamwork, leadership, and time management. These roles taught me the importance of quick decision-making and problem-solvingâ€”qualities that are just as critical in the tech industry.</p>
    <p> I believe that a successful developer needs more than just coding skills. My ability to collaborate effectively in teams, communicate clearly, and manage time efficiently allows me to approach projects holistically, ensuring that I deliver well-thought-out solutions on time and with attention to detail.</p>
    <p> I'm passionate about leveraging both my technical expertise and soft skills to develop innovative solutions and contribute to impactful projects in the tech world.</p>
